        <p> Hello Everyone! My name is Jared and i am from the islands of Fiji.
            I am so grateful for opportunity to do this semester with you. The reason i chose to do this course is because i am planning to become a data Scientist.
            Ive been a member of the Church for about 16 years now and it has been wonderful. Through the good and bad times ive learned to become a better person.
            I am excited to take this journey with each on of you and looking forward to learn with you. 
        </p>
